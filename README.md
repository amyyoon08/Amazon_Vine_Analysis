## Summary 

- Positivity Bias: It can be seen from the dataFrame that there is a huge gap between Vine and non-Vine reviews. In this datasets, there is 0$ of Vine-members provide a 5 stars review. However, to undestand what causes this situation, we need to do more analyzing about it. 
- Additional Analysis: we should consider other criteria in the dataFrame such as 'verified_purchased' or 'helpful_votes' which is lower than 50%.
